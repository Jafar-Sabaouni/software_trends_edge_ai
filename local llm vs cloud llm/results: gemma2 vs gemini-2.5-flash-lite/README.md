# Conclusion: Gemma2 vs Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite

This was to test out the difference between cloud and local. I noticed that this test was not really stable since the variables changed depending on the desktop and the cloud model. For example, in this test, I used Gemma 2 which has 2B parameters and compared it to Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite which has 5B parameters.

While acknowledging the hardware and model size differences, this benchmark indicates a clear
trade-off. Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite (Cloud) demonstrated superior performance in both speed and the
quality of its responses. However, Gemma2 (Local) offers the key advantages of offline access and
zero cost-per-query, which are critical for many edge AI applications.

The choice between them would depend heavily on whether performance and accuracy or accessibility
and cost are the primary concern for a given use case.
